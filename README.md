# Module 10 Employee Tracker


# DESCRIPTION 

This is an employee tracker that allows for the management of the departments, roles and employees.  It was an assignment for bootcamp class. It requests that we use a CMS to easily view and interact with the information. 

This module also helped address the thing that I couldn't put into words until now. HOW TO BUILD A MODULE FROM SCRATCH AND THE PROCESS BEHIND IT.

# PROCESS

I come from a sales/education/music/anthropology background.  I went to the University of MN and have most of my BA and masters degree in Anthropology done. (I was working a double degree to save money) I was taught research by some of the best in the world at the time. I know how to interview people to get the job done and figure out what they need even if they don't understand what they need. I am also frugal and demand that my money is spent well and that I get the most bang for my buck. 

That means... I want the most out of the education that was paid for.

That also means... I am part of a community and need to keep working on improving it and making it better for the learners who follow. Just because I struggled doesn't mean others have to.

I would like to address the elephant in the room.  HOW DO I EVEN START?

The problem with these assignments and the modules they give us...is that as a user, I am a bootcamp student who doesn't have the basic framework in place to build a module. I don't know what I need. I don't know where to start... I know that I covered aspects of this module in class but I have no clue what the framework looks like.  The Getting started on project, which I have also inclded here did not give me any direction on which folders I needed what modules were required.  How do I even install the packages? I am having so much information thrown at me.  Even if you told me and we covered it in class I can't put it together yet. I am so lost...
This ideas were echoed with my fellow cohorts.

THIS IS THE WHY I FELT THE NEED TO ADD THE PROCESS.

 So I felt compelled to explain the HOW TO BUILD AN APP FROM SCRATCH HERE.  This was hinted at but NEVER covered in class. THIS IS ESSENTIAL FOR A JUNIOR DEVELOPER. These are the basic building blocks needed but just assumed that we know even when we don't come from a computing background.  I feel like this point is also missing in the buildup to the modules.  I am not the only one who feels this way in my Bootcamp class.

As an artist... before I start a project, I research what others have done.  I look up examples and I take away what I loved and what I thought could be improved and then I add to it and make it my own.  As a bootcamp student, I have heard the words "Look it up", but now it's just a constant drone in the back of my head because it's been said so many times. What do I even look up?  So I combined my artist project process and started by googling Employee tracker.  See [Contributing Resources](#contributing)

I read other peoples code, I looked at their blueprints to understand what I needed for my own project.  Most importantly I looked at their folders for the idea on HOW to structure the overall project. This is where I learned that I needed certain folders.  The important take away is that I used at least 3-5 sources for each topic within the topic that is contained within this module and I cited them. 

I used the code as outlines as to what to do next.  I questioned my AI when it would try and auto fill.  I went back and looked at the other examples to make sure I was on the right track. When I started seeing similar things reoccuring that is when I had my Eurika moment and made it my own.  

I then went step by step and googled how to do each of the folders.  I also decided to add PRISMA because I wanted to see if I could.

I then hit a wall as I was writing the code.  So I did what any research scientist would do... I left notes at the areas I did not understand.  I then went in and discussed those areas with my teacher and the TA.  They gave me the direction I needed to go.   and I left myself notes in the areas of the project on what to do next.  I then went back in and googled it. I repeated this process until I had a working app.

I wrote out the code long hand because I still dont understand 1/4 of it unless I am in it and then when I walk away from it my brain forgets so I need to WRITE IT OUT. I also left myself notes on what I needed to work on and what I don't understand and this is why Markdown as part of the process is so important.

Here is the Following Outline of what I did.

## FOR CLASS REQUIREMENTS MUST DO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING

## USER STORY
 I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company SO THAT I can organize and plan my business.

 ## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

 * I should be GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input WHEN I start the application.

* THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role.

* WHEN I choose to view all departments...THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids

* WHEN I choose to view all roles...THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role

* WHEN I choose to view all employees...THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to

* WHEN I choose to add a department...THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database

* WHEN I choose to add a role...THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database

* WHEN I choose to add an employee...THEN I am prompted to enter the employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database

* WHEN I choose to update an employee role...THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database

## GETTING STARTED ON PROJECT

You'll need to use the pg package Links to an external site. to connect to your PostgreSQL database and perform queries, and the Inquirer package Links to an external site. to interact with the user via the command line.

<img src="Assets/100-sql-challenge-ERD.png" alt="a graph with department, role, and employee" title="your schema should contain the following three tables">

As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

* department
  * id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  * name: VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE NOT NULL to hold department name

* role
    * id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
    * title: VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE NOT NULL to hold role title
    * salary: DECIMAL NOT NULL to hold role salary
    * department_id: INTEGER NOT NULL to hold reference to department role belongs to

* employee
    * id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
    * first_name: VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL to hold employee first name
    * last_name: VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL to hold employee last name
    * role_id: INTEGER NOT NULL to hold reference to employee role
    * manager_id: INTEGER to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)


You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.

## BONUS

#### Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* Update employee managers.

* View employees by manager.

* View employees by department.

* Delete departments, roles, and employees.

* View the total utilized budget of a department—in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
